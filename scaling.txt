Now that the model is stored in data.pth, It's easy to intergrate it with Python Flask or Django.
Simply create a Web App with Flask framwork, and take in the user input from the input form.
Create a route to handle the response once user submit the form, and intergrate the code in chat.py.
Once the web app is ready, we can just deploy the whole project onto Heroku.
